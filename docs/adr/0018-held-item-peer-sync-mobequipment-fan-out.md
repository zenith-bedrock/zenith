# ADR §18 — Held-item peer sync (MobEquipment fan-out)

> Part of the [decision log](README.md). Code and docs cite this record as `ADR §18`.

**Choice:** Handler still only updates `SelectedHotbarSlot` (MobEquipment / IT). `EquipmentSystem` on tick compares held slot + stack fingerprint to last broadcast; if changed, fan-out `MobEquipment` Encode to other in-game peers (same pattern as `MovementSystem`). `AddPlayer` includes held `ItemInstance` (legacy wire) from current hotbar. Stack net IDs omitted on peer view (display only). No armor/offhand.

**Why:** After §17, A’s hotbar is authoritative but peers still saw empty hands — smoke 3–4 incomplete for “looks multiplayer.” Chests can wait; this is cheaper and closes a visible MP gap.

**Deferred:** chests/containers, inventory persist across reconnect, drop entity.
